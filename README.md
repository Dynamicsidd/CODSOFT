1. todo.cpp
  The program enters a loop that displays a menu of options:

"Add Task": Allows the user to input a new task, which is added to the to-do list.
"Remove Task": Prompts the user to enter the index of a task to remove it from the list.
"Display Tasks": Shows the current list of tasks.
"Quit": Exits the program.
Depending on the user's choice, the program calls the corresponding function to perform the desired action.
The program continues looping until the user selects the "Quit" option, at which point it exits.
Overall, this code demonstrates basic input/output operations, the use of vectors for managing a list of tasks, and menu-driven functionality for creating a simple to-do list application in C++.
 
2. guess.cpp
The Number Guessing Game is a classic interactive game designed to challenge players' ability to guess a randomly chosen number within a specified range. The game generates a random target number and provides the player with a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number. After each guess, the game provides feedback to the player, indicating whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the target number. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number or exhausts all attempts.

3. calculator.cpp
calculator program that performs basic arithmetic
operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. Allow the user to input two numbers and choose an
operation to perform.
