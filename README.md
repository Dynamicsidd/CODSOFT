The Number Guessing Game is a classic interactive game designed to challenge players' ability to guess a randomly chosen number within a specified range. The game generates a random target number and provides the player with a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number. After each guess, the game provides feedback to the player, indicating whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the target number. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number or exhausts all attempts.
